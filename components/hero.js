          At Magpie English our mission is to give you the attention that you
          need in order to discover the language within you. Everybody has a
          different language that's unique to them; thatâ€™s your voice. Using the
          three foundations of language learning: Fluency, Self-Confidence, and
          Creativity we wish to help you discover your voice.
